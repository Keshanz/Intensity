Welcome to Intensity!

Your player is a small circle that you move with the arrow keys. 
Holding B will make your circle go twice as fast and holding A makes you invincible as long as the bar at the bottom is not empty.
Beware as the bar charges much, much slower than it is used.
The goal of the game is to eliminate as many enemies as possible while staying alive.
Enemies are eliminated by running into them.  Each kill adds 1 to your score.
However, they are armed with their own unique weapons.  Each time a bullet hits you, you lose 1 life of the 15 you start with.

ORANGE - Most basic type
Shoots basic 1 pixel bullets, fairly average speed and fire cooldown.

YELLOW - Shotgun type
Shoots 5 bullets at once but has a long cooldown

ORANGE+ 
Faster version of ORANGE.  Shoots fast and moves fast.

BLUE - Bounce type
Shoots large bouncing bullets.  Fairly long cooldown and fairly slow

RED - Sniper type
Shoots very fast, fairly accurate bullets. Long cooldown and barely moves.
However, they increase in difficulty much faster than others if left alive too long

PURPLE - Explosion type
Shoots a large purple bullet that explodes into three bouncing bullets.
Very long cooldown and very low movement.

Tips:

1. It's safe to hit enemies right after they fire since they have a cooldown.  Alternatively you can use invincibility to get them scotch-free.
2. Don't let any enemies stay on screen too long.  They get harder over time and some even get new bullets...
(This was implemented to prevent players from just leaving 7 ORANGES on the screen and killing the remaining enemy)
3. At higher scores, enemies spawn faster and harder enemies tend to spawn more.  Keep this in mind if it seems easy at first.

Good luck and have fun!  Try getting a higher score than 100!
